# Terms and Definitions:

In here we describe all the terms and concepts handled during the full documentation.


## 1. Service Agreement:
Is the document agreed with Cobuild Lab'w Customer that defines the scope of a project, it’s milestones and deliverables. 

This document is produced by the (Account Manager)[/roles] from the Sales Department and must be handled over to the Project Manager and to the full development team.


## 2. Execution Plan:
Is a document produced by the (Development Team)[/roles] to compromise milestones and deliverables on their behalf. 
This is an internal document managed by the Project Manager that allows the team to produce internal deliverables if necessary. 

This document can be produced after the Service Agreement has been signed upon or before by the Customer. Milestones and deliverables can’t supersede the Service Agreement commitments with the Customer and it is the responsibility of the Project Manager that this never happened. 

## 3. Business Rules Document:
Due to the nature of Software Development, not all the Business Rules are defined in the Service Agreement, and many arise later from the development process or from Client Meetings.

# Convention for Kanban board in Github Projects

In order to properly manage the columns or stages in the project Kanban, a convention has been developed. 

The convention is centered around the IN PROGRESS stage or column, where all the columns from the left are planning columns, representing priority to be developed, and all the columns from the right are environment columns where the features and bug fixes move forward.
